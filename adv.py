# I want to find the closes room that hasnâ€™t been iterate through using bfs from that first node (the current node we are on)

# *** Plan ***
# Create a dft function 
# Create a stack to add our nodes that are being iterated through into
# Push our starting node since we've been to it into the stack
# create a variable called visited and assign set() to it so we can call visited nodes
# Loop through our stack = ps: the nodes that are being iterated through 
# creating a varibale called current_node so once we are on our current node we can pop() it from our stack
# we want to add current node to our visited set 
# then create a varibale that's qeual to our empty list (traversal_path) with our current_nodde in it ~ this allows us to take from our already looped node and pop it off the stack and out it into our list (traversal_path) to keep track of
# if our neighbor_node is in our list push that node argument === (neighbor_node) back into our stack to loop through back to the top
